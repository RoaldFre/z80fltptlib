Z80 floating point library for fast Iterated Function System generator on a 
TI-83/84 calculator.

Specs of floating point library:
  * 16 bit two's complement mantissa
  * 8 bit two's complement exponent
  * functions for sum, difference, product
  * functions for transition between this format and the TI BCD format

Specs of the IFS:
  * Supports an arbitrary number of fixed points
  * Each fixed point is characterized by:
      - a coordinate
      - a rotation angle
      - a compression factor

Notes on using the IFS Generator:
  * Still only beta quality. A sierpinski triangle will work, but more 
    elaborate systems (with rotations) might crash your calc
  * Usage: use the TI-Basic wrapper IFSFPASM and make sure that Ans holds a 
    matrix with on each row the x component, the y component, the rotation 
    angle, the contraction factor of the fixed point.
    For the sierpinsky triangle, you enter:
       [[0,0,0,2],[0,1,0,2],[1,0,0,2]]:prgmIFSFPASM

If you use or modify this code, please let me know so I can share in on the 
fun ;-). (Also contact me for the exact licence on this code. It will 
probably be under the GPL, but I haven't fullf made up my mind yet.)
